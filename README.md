# 💹 Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization

A hybrid approach that combines classical portfolio theory with quantum-inspired algorithms to optimize asset allocation for better risk-return trade-offs.

## 📌 Abstract

Portfolio optimization is a fundamental challenge in finance: maximize expected returns while minimizing risk. This project proposes a novel hybrid framework that leverages **quantum-inspired simulated annealing** to enhance the search for globally optimal portfolio weights under constraints. 

It combines classical **Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** with a **quantum annealing-inspired** solution mechanism to escape local optima and find better configurations, even in complex financial environments.
